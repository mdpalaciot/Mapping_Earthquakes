# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
The objective is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API, create and explore interactive maps of earthquakes around the world. The earthquake data is represented on the maps in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and according to each event's magnitude.
